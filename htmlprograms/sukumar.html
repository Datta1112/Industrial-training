Early life and family <br>
Sukumar was born on 11 January 1970,[1][2] in Mattaparru, a village near Malikipuram in erstwhile East Godavari district (present-day Konaseema district) of Andhra Pradesh.[5] His father Tirupathi Rao Naidu was a rice trader and his mother Veera Veni was a homemaker. Sukumar was the youngest of the six children of Naidu and Veni. At the age of 6, following the slaughter of a rooster he loved, Sukumar practiced vegetarianism for a long time.[5] <br>

He did his schooling from Zilla Parishad High School, Razole and graduated with a master's degree in mathematics.[6] He later worked as a mathematics and physics lecturer in Aditya Junior college, Kakinada.[7] After nearly seven years,[8][9] Sukumar and his junior Prakash Toleti decided to do something creative as they opined that their life has become too mundane as a lecturer.[10] <br>

Career <br>
Sukumar and Toleti began their career as writers in Telugu cinema and worked as writers for a few films. After writing three scenes for Jayanth C. Paranjee's Bavagaru Bagunnara? (1998), they were summoned by the college to help them in recruiting students. They walked out of the film on moral grounds.[10] Due to lack of earnings, Sukumar briefly continued to teach students, earned money, and returned back to film industry.[7] He worked as an assistant director for Manasichi Choodu (1998).[11] Sukumar later assisted Editor Mohan for Kshemamga Velli Labhamga Randi (2000) and Hanuman Junction (2001). Before making his directorial debut, Sukumar worked under V. V. Vinayak for Dil (2003) as an assistant director.[9] <br>

Debut and breakthrough: 2004–2011 <br>
Sukumar began working on the script of his directorial debut Arya (2004) in Visakhapatnam before joining the sets of Vinayak's Dil. Its producer Dil Raju assured that he would produce the film if Dil becomes a commercial success.[12] Sukumar chose to narrate the story of a boy who confess his love to a girl right in the beginning, opposed to films like Darr (1993), Kabhie Haan Kabhie Naa (1994), and Kaadhal Kondein (2003) where the protagonist's love/obsession for the female lead is revealed towards the end, as he found that idea an "obsolete" one.[9] Raju was impressed with Sukumar's script and Allu Arjun was selected as its protagonist after considering Ravi Teja, Nithin, and Prabhas. Anuradha Mehta and Siva Balaji were chosen for the other two lead roles.[13] R. Rathnavelu and Devi Sri Prasad were chosen as the film's director of photography and music director respectively; they both collaborated with Sukumar in many of his future projects. Arya was commercially successful; it grossed ₹16 crore on a budget of ₹4 crore.[13] The success of Arya catapulted Sukumar into stardom overnight.[9] He earned the Filmfare Award for Best Director – Telugu at the 52nd Filmfare Awards South ceremony,[14] and the Best Screenplay Writer award at the annual Nandi Awards ceremony.[15] <br>

Sukumar then began working on the script of Jagadam (2007), a crime film starring Ram Pothineni and Isha Sahni. Unlike Arya, Jagadam focused more on violence and in an interview with South Scope, Sukumar called the film an "act of bravado", adding that he "made it with an innocent passion", without thinking about the audience's response.[9] Jagadam received mixed reviews and was a commercial failure.[9] While Sify called the film a "not so much a plot-driven film" albeit praising the work of its technical crew,[16] Rediff called it a "good effort".[17] He then wrote and directed Arya 2 (2009), which was promoted as the namesake sequel of his debut Arya. It featured Allu Arjun, Kajal Aggarwal, and Navdeep in the lead roles and narrated the story of Arya, a psychotic orphan whose love for his friend Ajay and his colleague Geetha is never reciprocated.[18] The film received mixed reviews from critics. However, Arya 2 became one of the few successful Telugu films of the year,[19] and was praised for its style quotient and music.[9] Sukumar received a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Director – Telugu at the 57th Filmfare Awards South ceremony,[20] but lost it to S. S. Rajamouli for Magadheera.[21] Rajamouli stated that he regards Sukumar as the best of the lot after watching Arya 2, which according to Sukumar "was the most precious and sweetest thing I have heard about myself".[9] <br>

After a gap of two years, Sukumar's next directorial film 100% Love (2011) was released. Sukumar envisioned the film's concept 15 years ago, which dealt with the simple conflicts couples face and the way they solve them, and made changes based on the technological and behavioural developments of the students in the colleges.[9] 100% Love featured Naga Chaitanya and Tamannaah in the lead roles and was produced by Allu Aravind and Bunny Vasu.[22] 100% Love was commercially successful;[23] it received the Best Home-viewing Feature Film award at the annual Nandi Awards ceremony.[24] Sukumar earned another nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Director – Telugu at the 59th Filmfare Awards South,[25] and a nomination for the Best Director – Telugu at the 1st South Indian International Movie Awards.[26] <br>
